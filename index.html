            At most places I've joined, leadership development was missing, learning data was limited, or training didn't connect to real business problems. I work with leaders to figure out what's needed, design the programmes, and deliver them — across manufacturing, multi-business groups, tech, and higher education.

         2. HOW I WORK — 2x2 grid
    ============================== -->
    <section id="how-i-work" class="section">
      <h2 class="section-label">How I Work</h2>
      <div class="work-grid">
        <div class="work-cell" >
          <h3 class="work-cell-title">Start with what learners actually need</h3>
          <p>Before designing anything, I try to understand the real situation — whether that's through conversations with managers, learning needs analysis with participants, or working with HRBPs. Sometimes the need is clear, sometimes people don't yet know what they need. Either way, I dig into it before building content. Even when hiring external vendors, I run learning needs analysis with learners first so the programme fits, not just fills a schedule.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="work-cell" >
          <h3 class="work-cell-title">Build with what's available</h3>
          <p>Not every organisation has a big L&D budget — especially after COVID. At Dai Viet Group, I negotiated trainer fees down by half, invited internal experts and external volunteers to teach, and worked with developers to build a gamification platform. The full leadership programme ran on a fraction of the original estimated cost.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="work-cell" >
          <h3 class="work-cell-title">Do the work, not just the plan</h3>
          <p>I design programmes and I also deliver them. I facilitate workshops, run training sessions, and stay close to how learners actually respond. At Samsung, that meant teaching across 3 shifts including night shifts to reach 10,000 factory workers. At RMIT, I facilitate sessions on AI, debate, and critical thinking — not just coordinate them.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="work-cell" >
          <h3 class="work-cell-title">Make learning part of how the organisation works</h3>
          <p>I focus on building systems that last beyond a single training event. At RMIT, learning hours grew from 7,000 to 11,000 per year — not because of one programme, but because of a series of initiatives: the first lunch & learn series, the first leadership programme for academic managers, the first AI productivity workshops, and 170+ staff participating in cross-department sharing for the first time.</p>

              <h4 class="project-section-label">Problem</h4>
              <p>RMIT Vietnam had no leadership development programme for academic programme managers. These managers handled both academic and people responsibilities but had no structured support for the leadership side.</p>

            <div class="project-section">
              <h4 class="project-section-label">What I did</h4>
              <p>Worked with senior leaders to identify the key gaps. Designed a hybrid programme combining in-person workshops with digital follow-up. Built reflection journals in Padlet for peer learning. Focused on practical tools — coaching conversations, feedback frameworks — not just theory.</p>
            </div>

              <h4 class="project-section-label">Result</h4>

              <p>A leading e-commerce logistics operation was building one of its largest sorting centres while facing high rider turnover and increasing competition. Hub managers needed to lead their teams through constant operational changes but had no framework or tools to do it.</p>

            <div class="project-section">
              <h4 class="project-section-label">What I did</h4>
              <p>Worked with the Regional Operations Manager and HRBP to understand the specific challenges on the ground. Designed a half-day workshop combining a simulation game I created (later reused across multiple business entities), real case studies built with the Ops Manager, and a practical change management framework teams could use immediately.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="project-section">
              <h4 class="project-section-label">Result</h4>
              <p>4.8/5 on "can apply back to work." Most common feedback: wanted more sessions. The simulation game was adopted for workshops across food delivery and business development teams.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="project-context">Designed and facilitated leadership workshops across 4 entities — logistics, business development, food delivery — each customised to the team's specific challenges.</p>

              <h4 class="project-section-label">Problem</h4>
              <p>Dai Viet Group (~800 employees, multiple business lines) had no structured leadership development. Leaders worked in silos and rarely understood each other's work. Budget was severely limited post-COVID.</p>

            <div class="project-section">
              <h4 class="project-section-label">What I did</h4>
              <p>Worked directly with CEO, CFO, and CHRO to design the programme. Kept costs low by negotiating trainer fees, inviting an ex-McKinsey strategist and other experts to teach pro bono, and leveraging internal managers as mentors. Built case studies with the CEO and designed a capstone project. Worked with developers to create a gamification website tracking participation across workshops, book reviews, and article summaries. In parallel, ran 52 knowledge-sharing sessions with internal SMEs from IT, marketing, finance, and other teams.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="project-section">
              <h4 class="project-section-label">Result</h4>
              <p>45 senior managers completed the 6-month programme. Leaders reported better cross-department understanding. The gamification system and SME sharing series created ongoing learning habits beyond the formal programme.</p>
